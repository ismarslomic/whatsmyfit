> Whats my fit APIs

## Prerequisites
- Node + NPM + Yarn (`brew install yarn`)
- TSLint + Typescript (`yarn global add tslint typescript`)

## Install It
```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Run It
#### Run in *development* mode:

```bash
$ yarn dev
```

#### Run in *production* mode:

```bash
$ yarn compile
$ yarn start
```

### Try It
* Point you're browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* Read API documentation with Swagger UI [http://localhost:3000/api-explorer/](http://localhost:3000/api-explorer/)

## Linting
```bash
$ yarn pretest
```

## Test It

```bash
$ yarn test
```

## Environments
- `test` - runs locally or on Heroku CI when executing `yarn test`
- `development` - runs locally when executing `yarn dev`, url: http://localhost:3000
- `staging` - runs in `staging` phase of Heroku Pipeline when pull requests are merged to `master` branch, when executing `yarn start`, url: https://staging.whatsmy.fit
- `production` - runs in `production` phase of Heroku Pipeline when `manually` promoted from staging, when executing `yarn start`, url: https://whatsmy.fit

## Skip CI jobs
Sometimes when pushing changes unrelated to applicationÂ´s code it can be useful to avoid new CI builds. 
Commits that have `[ci skip]` or `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit messages are ignored by Travis CI., read more at [TravisCI: Skipping a build](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/#Skipping-a-build)

## Security
- TLS is enabled for `staging` and `production` environments by enabling TLS in Heroku. In addition ExpressJS server 
is configured to redirect all requests from HTTP to HTTPS, see [sslRedirect.ts](server/common/sslRedirect.ts), for these two environments
- `NSP` (Node Security Platform) checks automatically for security vulnerabilities of third-party packages, see `nsp` badge for latest status. In addition you can run nsp checks with `yarn check:nsp`
- `Snyk` finds and fix security vulnerabilities of third-party packages, see `vulnerabilities` badge for latest status. It will run nightly and for all PRs. In addition you can run snyk checks with 
`yarn check:snyk` to get report and snyk wizard to open a wizard that walks you through the process of applying updates or patches to fix the vulnerabilities that were found.
